<p>
Coral reefs are threatened by dozens of things that you can’t control including hurricanes, more alkaline pH levels, and warmer temperatures due to global warming. 
But, your sunscreen could cost many reefs lives. Many coastal countries are starting to ban oxybenzone and microplastic sunscreens due to their highly toxic chemicals.
A 2015 study shows that ONE DROP of Oxybenzone sunscreen can contaminate 6.5 olympic sized pools. With only about 4% of the reefs that we had since 2000, anything matters.
Not only corals are in danger, with many non-mineral sunscreens including microplastics, you could be killing a sea turtle, or even a whale. 
By getting into water with sunscreen, your sunscreen dissolves into the ocean. By spreading the word and finding the right brands at your local convenience store, you could be saving the ocean.
