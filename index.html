<h1>Sunscreen and Coral Reefs</h1>

<div class="content-box">
  Coral reefs are threatened by dozens of factors that you can’t control including hurricanes, more alkaline pH levels, and warmer water temperatures due to global warming. 
  But one thing within your grasp is sunscreen. Your sunscreen could contaminate large bodies of water and harm reefs. Many coastal countries are starting to ban oxybenzone and microplastic sunscreens due to their highly toxic chemicals.
  <br><br>
  A 2015 study shows that a single drop of oxybenzone sunscreen can contaminate 6.5 Olympic-sized pools (Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology). 
  With only about 25% of the reefs in the Great Barrier Reef off the coastline of Australia still alive compared to the year 2000, the smallest actions matter.
  <br><br>
  Non-mineral sunscreens not only threaten coral, but the microplastics they contain also could suffocate a sea turtle, or even contribute to a whale's demise. 
  When you go into the water, your sunscreen dissolves in the ocean. Instead of spreading the harm, you should spread the word and find the right brands at your local store to save the ocean.
