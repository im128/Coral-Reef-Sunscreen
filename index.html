Coral reefs are threatened by dozens of things that you can’t control including hurricanes, more alkaline pH levels, and warmer temperatures due to global warming. 
But, your sunscreen could cost many reefs lives. Many coastal countries are starting to ban oxybenzone and microplastic sunscreens due to their highly toxic chemicals.
A 2015 study shows that ONE DROP of Oxybenzone sunscreen can contaminate 6.5 olympic sized pools (Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology). With only about 25% of the reefs that we compared to 2000, the smallest actions matter (Great Barrier Reef Foundation Analysis).
Not only are corals in danger, with many non-mineral sunscreens including microplastics, you could be suffocating a sea turtle, or even contributing to a murdered whale. 
By getting into water with sunscreen, your sunscreen dissolves into the ocean. Instead of spreading the harm, you should spread the word and find the right brands at your local convenience store to save the ocean.
